## Description

This project implements a doubly linked list with various operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal, showcased mainly in list.cpp (task1 to task6) as required by the assignment.

## Task Descriptions

Descriptions for each task are as follows (from `list.cpp`):

- **task1:** Insert a new item node into an empty list.
- **task2:** Insert a new item node in front of the list.
- **task3:** Print all data in the list in backward order.
- **task4:** Insert a new item node at the middle of the list.
- **task5:** Delete the item node at the middle of the list.
- **task6:** Delete the last node in the list.

## How to Build and Run

1. **Build:**  
   Press `Ctrl+Shift+B` in Visual Studio Code to build the project.
